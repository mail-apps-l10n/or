<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (aboutPrivateBrowsing.width1):
     Width of the Private Browsing section. This should depend primarily on the
     length of the headers and text, but should be roughly 1.5 times the width
     of the Tracking Protection section, and in general not much larger than
     30em to prevent the sections from wrapping on smaller window sizes.

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (trackingProtection.width1):
     Width of the Tracking Protection section. It is fine for the enabled or
     disabled indicator or the words in the title to wrap to the next line, but
     you can expand or reduce this section to fit better, as long as the width
     of the Private Browsing section is roughly 1.5 times the width of this one.
     Note that the required space may vary between platforms because fonts are
     different, so testing on Windows, Mac, and Linux is encouraged.

<!-- LOCALIZATION NOTE (trackingProtection.state.width):
     Width of the element representing the enabled or disabled indicator.
